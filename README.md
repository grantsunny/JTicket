# JTicket - A Java based open source ticketing system

## Overview
This is an open sourced ticketing system. 
Given my background worked in multiple ticketing company, this project is built completely with my spare time. 
I were trying to leverage latest Java technologies to build it as I found there are quite a lot 
out of dated technologies being used in the ticketing business making it as an old-fashioned technology. 

Ticketing can be with emerging technologies! So it ship with:
* Pure cloud-native and Kubernetes way to package and deployment
* Latest spring boot and spring security technologies 
* In memory SQL database based on Java, distributed if needed 

This project is open-sourced under the license of Apache 2.0 (https://www.apache.org/licenses/). 
Please feel free to raise one issue or join me to contribute it.
